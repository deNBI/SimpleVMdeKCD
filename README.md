# SimpleVM Workshop (Short Version)

This workshop demonstrates a typical workflow of a SimpleVM user and is based on a [longer workshop](https://github.com/deNBI/simpleVMWorkshop).
In this workshop your goal will be to identify pathogenic bacteria
that were classified as "greatest threat to human health" by the 
World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2017: https://www.who.int/news/item/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-needed

You will search for those microbes
in publicly available metagenomic datasets that are stored in the 
Sequence Read Archive ([SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)). 
In metagenomics, microbial genetic material 
is extracted from environmental samples like human gut, soil, 
freshwater or biogas plants in order to investigate the functions and
interactions of the microbial community.

In order to find those microbes, you will have to interact with 
the de.NBI Cloud via SimpleVM. This workshop is divided into three
parts.

### Section 1: Start your VM
In the first part you will learn the basic concept of virtual machines and how to configure them.

**[Go to the first section](part1.md)**

### Section 2: Verify your VM properties and tools
In the second section you will test whether SimpleVM correctly provisioned your VM with all your tools installed on it.

**[Go to the second section](part2.md)**

### Section 3: Basic data management in the cloud
In the third section, you will learn how to work with your data in a cloud environment and with object storage.
